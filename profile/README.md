## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

It's hard to moderate. In moderating human issues in order to reach a fair conclusion, all the parts should be impartial. But having impartial humans that are capable of reaching fair conclusions is quite difficult. All the participants have to provide the context, the laws available, and deliberate on it to reach a conclusion. Then, we reached the conclusion that if we can provide the laws (or rules) and the context to an AI, it might be able to reach similar conclusions as humans, but faster ar arguably more impartial. 

Ideally, all the context and rules necessary will be provided by the the parties interested in the decision. Also ideally, the decision by the AI will always end in one of the multiple ends and in the most fair.

In reality, since AI's are non-deterministic we already know they will fail in some cases to provide a fair decision. Or even provide a decision, but not the most fair. What we expect with our solution is some decision to be made in most cases, the closest possible to the most fair for all participants affected by the decision. 

(((write about realiity once we have implemented the solution. One thing that we will face for sure, is the fact that participants will attempt to provide false context or remove context from past participants.)))

Our implementation has the potential to reduce costs in making decisions of moderation, by needing less human parts and time to reach a conclusion.


- IDEAL: This section is used to describe the desired or ‚Äúto be‚Äù state of the process or product. At large, this section
  should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
- REALITY: This section is used to describe the current or ‚Äúas is‚Äù state of the process or product.
- CONSEQUENCES: This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon.
  This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth.

Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used to understand the problem and elicit
requirements that will lead to a winning solution.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This section is used to describe potential solutions.

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if
  appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```
